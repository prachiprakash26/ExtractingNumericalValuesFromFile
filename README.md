# ExtractingNumericalValuesFromFile
The python code is created to extract numerical values from a given file

This python code needs only one input - File name (txt format) along with the file path. It will then extract all numerical values from the file and display at the end.

Inspiration: A file was given for a hack. This invloved identifying the location based on the zip code (numeric) that were randomly placed inside the huge junk of word/weird characters within a text file. Instead of manually going through the huge file, it made sense to automate the process and parse the numerical values instead.
